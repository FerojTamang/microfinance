      <h2>Financial Literacy: Understanding Savings</h2>
      <p>Savings is the process of setting aside a portion of your income for future use. It helps you achieve financial security and meet long-term goals.</p>
      <h3>How Savings Works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Create a Budget:</strong> Track your income and expenses to identify how much you can save monthly.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Goals:</strong> Decide what youâ€™re saving for, such as an emergency fund or a big purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose a Savings Method:</strong> Use a savings account, fixed deposit, or invest in low-risk options.</li>
        <li><strong>Automate Savings:</strong> Set up automatic transfers to ensure consistent saving.</li>
        <li><strong>Review Regularly:</strong> Adjust your savings plan as your financial situation changes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By saving regularly, you can build a safety net and reduce reliance on loans. Start small and increase your savings over time!</p>
